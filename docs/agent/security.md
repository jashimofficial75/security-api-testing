title: Security: a static site with nothing to steal
read-when: before adding a script, an embed, an external link or image host, a header, a CSP change or a dependency; and before telling the owner a change is done
---
There is no server, database or session here, so most attacks have nothing to reach. What is
left is the browser: keep scripts out, keep the headers on, keep secrets out of the repo.

## No secrets, ever
- Everything in this repo and in `dist/` is public: anyone can read it. Never put a key, token,
  password or private URL in code, Markdown, `PUBLIC_*` env vars, `.env` (git-ignored, and not
  used by the build) or HTML. You cannot add secrets to a static site; a feature that needs one
  needs the Astro app template (AGENTS.md).

## Content-Security-Policy (`security.csp` in `astro.config.mjs`)
- Astro writes the policy into every page with a hash for each script and style it emits.
  Never add `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'`, never weaken `default-src 'self'`.
- So: no inline event handlers (`onclick=`), no `style=""` attributes (use classes), no
  `javascript:` links, no third-party `<script src>` tags, no `is:inline` scripts.
- `connect-src 'self'`: the browser calls only this host (the live prices, the Buy button's
  checkout under the platform's path). Leave it. The one exception is built in: a page with a
  `<BuyButton>` allows the payment form's hosts (Stripe, Razorpay) on that page only
  (`src/lib/checkout-hosts.ts`, `payments.md`); never add a payment host or script yourself.
- A new embed host (a video player) goes into `frame-src` explicitly, by exact origin; images
  from https CDNs are already allowed (`img-src 'self' https: data:`). `form-action` allows this
  host and `mailto:` only.
- Markdown code blocks are not highlighted (`syntaxHighlight: false`): Shiki's inline styles
  would break the CSP. Keep it off.

## Headers (`public/_headers`)
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`,
`Permissions-Policy` (camera, microphone, geolocation, payment off), `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
same-origin`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and a year of immutable caching for `/_astro/*`. Keep them;
add, never remove. HTTPS and HSTS are the platform's. Never add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
(nothing here needs to be read by another site) or a header that loosens framing.

## HTML and URLs
- Astro escapes `{value}`. Never `set:html` / `innerHTML` with anything not written in this repo.
  Build DOM from data with `textContent`. HTML from outside the repo (pasted from a widget, an
  email) never goes into a page or a post; if the owner insists, sanitize it at build time.
- Markdown posts are trusted repo content and rendered as HTML: review what goes in.
- URLs from content: `https:` (and `mailto:` for email) only. `target="_blank"` always with
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- An `<iframe>` only from a host already in `frame-src`, with a `title`, and `sandbox` when the
  embed allows it.

## Dependencies and the supply chain
- Few dependencies, each one needed, versions pinned by the committed `package-lock.json`;
  `npm ci` installs exactly that. `allowScripts` in `package.json` lists the install scripts that
  may run: never widen it without the owner.
- Before adding one: is it needed at all (HTML, CSS and Astro cover most)? The exact name
  (typosquats like `astro-js`), maintained, widely used, no install script. Install a version
  (`npm install <name>@<version>`) and commit `package.json` with `package-lock.json`; no git or
  tarball URLs, no `latest`, no second lockfile, never edit `node_modules`.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` before done: report high/critical findings to the owner; never
  `npm audit fix --force` (it jumps major versions).
- No CDN scripts, styles or fonts at runtime, no `eval`, no `new Function`.

## Third-party embeds and links
- Each embed (video, map, form) is another company's code in a frame: only when the owner asks,
  from the privacy-friendly host where one exists (`youtube-nocookie.com`), lazy
  (`loading="lazy"`), never one that needs `'unsafe-inline'`.
- Links to other sites from content: `https:` only; `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with
  `target="_blank"`. Never a link that carries a visitor's data in its query string.

## Before you say "done"
No secret in the diff · no `'unsafe-*'`, inline handler, `style=""` or third-party script · new
hosts added to the exact CSP directive · `public/_headers` unchanged or stricter · `npm run build`
passes (a CSP or content-schema mistake fails it) · a new dependency is pinned in the lockfile
and `npm audit --omit=dev` was read.
